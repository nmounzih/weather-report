# weather-report


#H2 01. Intro

This is an app to practice hitting multiple APIs on a website. The website used was Weather Underground. The app will present a weather summary based on the zipcode that the user inputs.

#H2 02. Files

The weather.py file has the main function that will run the app. The user runs the app in python3 on the command line and will be prompted with a zipcode.
The weather_classes.py holds the classes of the program. The classes hold information that I chose to be presented in the summary from all the information given on the Weather Underground website.
